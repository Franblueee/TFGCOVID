Theorems can easily be defined

\cite{latexcompanion}


\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$ is 
	a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
	\label{pythagorean}
	This is a theorema about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
	equation 
	\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}

And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
corollary.

\begin{corollary}
	There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}

You can reference theorems such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.

\begin{lemma}
	Given two line segments whose lengths are $a$ and $b$ respectively there is a 
	real number $r$ such that $b=ra$.
\end{lemma}
